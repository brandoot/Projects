            Hi everyone, my name is Angel and I will be graduating in Spring
            2022! My major is Computer Science with an interest in Software
            Development. I love to be out in nature when possible, hang out with
            friends or family and doing hands-on projects like 3D printing!
            Working on this project opened up my eyes to how it will feel to
            work on a team and support one another to complete a common goal!

            philosophy, and psychology. Working on this app was stressful at
            times but also a great learning experience, I hope you enjoy what we

            and how these applications are designed and come together. I was the
            one to add the Chat feature along with the team, so if it breaks
            that's a you problem.
